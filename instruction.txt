I am building a real-time voting game using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
Before generating anything, strictly follow these rules:

First, analyze my requirements carefully and restate them briefly for confirmation.

Do NOT assume features that are not explicitly mentioned.

Keep my coding structure modular, scalable, and production-ready.

Avoid hallucinating APIs, libraries, or flows — only use realistic and commonly used MERN patterns.

If something is unclear, mark it as ‘NEEDS CONFIRMATION’ instead of guessing.

Generate tasks sequentially: verify completed tasks → pending tasks → next implementation steps.

Project Context

I want to create a fun voting game system where:

A user becomes a Host and creates a room (6-digit/alphanumeric ID, e.g., NanoID).

Host invites members via room ID (or share link/email).

After joining, host can create polls/questions.

Example: “Most handsome person” → members vote among invited users.

Voting duration: 15–20 seconds (configurable timer).

After timer ends, results automatically appear on UI.

Host can choose:

Anonymous voting OR

Visible usernames

UI must clearly show:

“This is an anonymous game” (if enabled)

“No public records shown” (UX message)

BUT in backend, we still securely track:

IP address

usernames

emails (for security/logging)

All rooms, questions, and votes are stored in DB (MongoDB).

Already Completed (IMPORTANT – Check First)

Basic MERN project setup (frontend + backend folder structure)

Authentication flow (login/signup) – JWT based

Basic UI layout (React + Tailwind)

Socket setup initialized (Socket.io basic connection)

You MUST:

Review these completed items first

Do not regenerate already completed parts

Only create tasks for missing modules

What I Need From You

Create a structured, Cursor-AI-friendly MARKUP document that includes:

Tech Stack Justification (MERN + Socket.io)

System Architecture (High-level)

Frontend Task Breakdown (step-by-step checklist)

Backend Task Breakdown (step-by-step checklist)

Database Schema Planning (Rooms, Users, Votes, Questions)

Real-time Flow (Host → Members → Vote → Result)

Folder Structure (keep scalable and clean)

API Design (only necessary endpoints, no overengineering)

Socket Events Design (room join, vote cast, timer end, result broadcast)

Security Notes (IP logging, abuse prevention, rate limiting)

Output Format Rules (Very Important)

Use structured markup (checklist style)

Separate sections: Frontend / Backend / Database / Realtime

Each task must have:

Objective

Status (Completed / Pending / In Progress)

Subtasks

Keep it production-oriented

No unnecessary explanations

No fictional tools or libraries

Follow step-by-step execution order (dependency based)

End goal: A clean, real-time, scalable voting game architecture that I can directly give to Cursor AI to implement code step-by-step without confusion or hallucinated features.
